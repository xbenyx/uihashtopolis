# INSTALLING & RUNNING

To install and run **UIHastopolis**, you need Docker or the last version of Nodejs. We recommend you install a package release since the master will often include untested features and modules.

We will release a beta soon.

## Pre-Installation - Setp up Back end API

1. Clone project `git clone -b feature/apiv2 https://github.com/hashtopolis/server.git`
2. Go to the  `.devcontainer` folder in the project and run `docker-compose up -d`

Notes:
- Can not create hashlist/files? You could be facing folder permissions. Run `chown vscode:vscode tmp/ files/ import/`


# Installation and set up UI using Docker (Recommended)

1. Install Docker Desktop

2. Clone the project or download the .zip (Before continuing read "**Config Global Settings**")

3. Run the multistage Dockerfile, Run `docker build -t hashtopolis-client .` (Careful with don't delete the dot)

4. Run `docker run -p 80:80 hashtopolis-client`

## Build the Docker UI Image

1. Run `docker-compose build nginx`.

2. Tag the image with your Docker Hub repo name:

    ```bash
    docker tag nginx-uihashtopolis <YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_NAME>/nginx-uihashtopolis
    ```

3. Push the image to Docker Hub:

    ```bash
    docker push <YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_NAME>/nginx-uihashtopolis
    ```

# Installation and compiling with Nodejs || Angular

1. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org.

2. Clone the project or download the .zip (Before continuing read "**Config Global Settings**")

3. Go to the folder then: Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

4. Run `ng build --watch` to build and bundle the code. Once compiled you can find the code in the `/dist` folder.

5. Run `npm start` to launch the App, alternative if you have installed Angular just run `ng server`

# Config Global Settings

As this application works entirely with REST API, you might need to make some changes to establish a seamless connection.  In some scenarios, you'll need to customize 2 files. 

## Connection
The first file is in src/config/default/app/main.ts  

* prodApiEndpoint: Backend API Default is `http://localhost:8080/api/v2`
* prodApiPort: Backend API port. As default is 8080
* frontEndUrl: Front API url. Default `http://localhost`

The second file is in src/proxy.conf.json

* target: Default is `http://localhost:8080/api/v2`
